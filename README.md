For those who want to practice some of the three areas in the frontend.
You can download this project and remove the file who you want to practice, example removing the js you can use the html and css structure to design your own javascript.

<strong>How it works</strong><br/>
You can simulate a purchase with free shipping or without free shipping, by entering zip code and increasing the item numbers. You can make your own currency, in this case it is the "real" currency of Brazil.
